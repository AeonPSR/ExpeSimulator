# Expedition Simulator

Chromee web extension for simulating planet expeditions with combat mechanics and probability calculations.

## Features

- Visual sector selection with interactive grid
- Player management with abilities and equipment
- Real-time probability calculations for events and combat
- Resource outcome projections

## TODO


- **Player HP End-Game Calculation**: Combat is done, need to integrate the damaging event in a smart way (we can't have a combat AND a damaging event at the same time...)
- Finishing integrating all items and abilities. We're basically missing stuff with personal effects, such has ropes and survival.
- **Planet Import System**: Import planet configurations from Astro chat or console
- **Scenario Export**: Export calculated scenarios for copy-paste into game chat
- **Sector Count **: Integrate the number of sectors explored during an expedition.
